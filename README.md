# GitHub to Slack Notification Workflow

This repository implements a GitHub Actions workflow that automatically sends structured Slack notifications when code is pushed to the `develop` branch. It enables development teams to stay informed in real-time about repository activity, supporting better visibility and coordination.

---

## üöÄ Overview

This workflow uses the [Slack GitHub Action](https://github.com/slackapi/slack-github-action) to send a visual notification to a Slack channel. The message includes:

- Repository name
- Target branch
- Commit author
- Commit message
- Timestamp
- Direct link to the commit

Slack messages are formatted using [Slack Block Kit](https://api.slack.com/block-kit) to enhance readability and usability.

## üì¶ Use Case

This automation is suitable for:

- Teams working across multiple repositories and needing clear identification of activity per project
- CI/CD pipelines that require notification on each push or deployment event
- Centralized Slack channels that aggregate version control activity from different projects
